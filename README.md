# Variational Bayesian Inference - A case study with multivariate Gaussian approximation

This project was part of a seminar during my Master studies in 
[Theoretical and Mathematical Physics](https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/TMP/) in 2018.
It's a small python project to classify an unknown amount of components in e.g. a CT scan.
